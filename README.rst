Selfhosted Platform
===================

Building up the things I selfhost as a source-controlled project. Goal here is
to have a single source for configuring all the things -- or at least a single
place where it's all documented, when that's not possible.

Setup
-----

Install the relevant OS:

* `Raspbian OS Lite`_ (pre-configure the wifi/hostname/ssh creds/etc before
  writing the image to save effort, ``sudo raspi-config`` afterwards to
  configure locale etc)
* `Debian`_ (skip the additional packages, but `set up networking`_ and ``apt
  install openssh-server``)

Configure your ssh keys (``ssh-copy-id $hostname``) and modify
``/etc/ssh/sshd_config`` how you'd like (``PermitRootLogin no`` and
``PasswordAuthentication no`` and pretty good improvements to the defaults).

From there, reboot, ssh into the new machine, and::

    sudo apt update -y
    sudo apt install -y --no-install-recommends git
    ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519 -C "KevinJames@thekev.in" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    git clone git@github.com:TheKevJames/selfhost ~/src/personal/selfhost
    cd ~/src/personal/selfhost

After this point, further steps depend on what functions this machine will
provide. First off, you probably want to mount `External Drives`_.

Once that's done, consider increasing your swap size and/or moving it onto one
of those drives. This is especially important for low-memory systems or cases
where your default swapfile lives on an SD card::

    sudo apt update -y
    sudo apt install -y --no-install-recommends dphys-swapfile

    sudo dphys-swapfile swapoff
    sudo vi /etc/dphys-swapfile
    # CONF_SWAPFILE=/mnt/1tb/swap
    # CONF_SWAPFACTOR=2
    sudo mv /var/swap /mnt/1tb/swap

    sudo dphys-swapfile setup
    sudo dphys-swapfile swapon
    sudo poweroff --reboot

Now, install your container manager::

    curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
    sudo sh ./get-docker.sh
    rm get-docker.sh
    sudo groupadd docker
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER  # then logout / login

    # on OSX, use colima for your Docker VM backend to avoid needing Docker for
    # OSX:
    https://github.com/abiosoft/colima

Once you've got a container manager, you can spin up everything defined in this
repo::

    # pre-configure any relevant secrets
    $ echo 'GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="..."' >> secrets/google.env
    $ echo 'GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="..."' >> secrets/google.env

    $ docker run --rm -it -v $PWD/cloudflared:/home/nonroot/.cloudflared cloudflare/cloudflared:latest tunnel login
    $ docker run --rm -it -v $PWD/cloudflared:/home/nonroot/.cloudflared cloudflare/cloudflared:latest tunnel create selfhost
    # modify cloudflared/config.yml with the new UUID
    $ bin/cloudflare-expose example.com
    $ bin/cloudflare-expose foo.example.com
    $ bin/cloudflare-expose bar.example.com

    # start images
    $ make pull
    $ make up -d

If this if the first time setup on a new machine and you want to migrate off a
previous one, using rsync on the relevant app directory should do the trick
(before you start the relevant pod, but after shutting it down on the old
host!)::

    rsync -aP oldhost:~/src/personal/selfhost/foobar/ foobar

If you did this, you may need to force Jellyfin to re-init by modifying
``jellyfin/system.xml`` to have::

    <IsStartupWizardCompleted>false</IsStartupWizardCompleted>

There are also some manual steps which you may want to do included below.

* syncthing: visit the web UI and share any folders
* pihole: ``docker logs pihole | grep random`` to get your password

You may also want to set up NTP. This is especially necessary if this machine
will be handling any auth, as handshakes will fail if your clock drifts too far
out of sync::

    sudo apt install ntp

Syncthing
~~~~~~~~~

Visit ``:8384`` and set up any relevant shares.

Pi-Hole
~~~~~~~

::

    # grab your admin password, configure settings in the web ui
    docker logs pihole | grep random

    # verify it works
    dig -4 @NODEIPv4 example.com
    # NODEIPv6=$( ip -6 addr show | awk '/global/ {print $2}'
    dig -4 @NODEIPv6 example.com

    # make your router/hosts/etc use pihole dns
    # https://docs.pi-hole.net/main/post-install/
    # note that if you want fallback DNS addresses, I like Cloudflare:
    #   1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1
    #   2606:4700:4700::1111, 2606:4700:4700::1001
    # verify it's configured:
    dig -4 example.com | grep SERVER
    dig -6 example.com | grep SERVER
    # the SERVER should be using the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses you found earlier

Updates
-------

To update the various components::

    sudo apt update -y
    sudo apt upgrade -y

    cd ~/src/experiments/selfhost
    git pull
    make pull
    make up -d

External Drives
---------------

Machines generally either mount external drives physically and expose them via
Samba, or mount them via Samba.

Physical Mounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Quick walkthrough of how to fstab some external drives into being auto-mounted::

    # find the drives
    $ lsblk -f
    NAME        FSTYPE FSVER LABEL  UUID                                 FSAVAIL FSUSE% MOUNTPOINT
    sda
    `-sda1      ext4   1.0          43162a5a-f1b2-441f-9d51-433bea2e113c
    sdb
    `-sdb1      ext4   1.0          b9479cb5-b306-430b-998d-3d793aadfde6

    # set up the mount points
    $ sudo mkdir /mnt/1tb /mnt/4tb

    # auto-mount 'em at startup
    $ echo "UUID=43162a5a-f1b2-441f-9d51-433bea2e113c /mnt/4tb  ext4  defaults,noatime  0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
    $ echo "UUID=b9479cb5-b306-430b-998d-3d793aadfde6 /mnt/1tb  ext4  defaults,noatime  0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
    $ sudo systemctl daemon-reolad

    # mount 'em now
    $ sudo mount -a

Exposing Mounts via Samba
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    sudo apt update -y
    sudo apt install -y --no-install-recommends samba samba-common-bin

    # configure drives
    # $ sudo vi /etc/samba/smb.conf
    # # For a readonly drive:
    # [pi-1tb]
    #   path = /mnt/1tb
    #   browseable = yes
    #   writeable = no
    #   guest ok = yes
    # # Or, to allow writes:
    # [pi-4tb]
    #   path = /mnt/4tb
    #   browseable = yes
    #   writeable = yes
    #   guest ok = yes
    #   public = yes
    #   create mask = 6444
    #   directory mask = 0755
    #   force user = pi
    #   force group = pi

    # create a samba user
    # eg. username is "pi"
    sudo smbpasswd -a pi

    # restart samba
    sudo systemctl restart smbd

Connect to Samba Shares
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To mount samba shares on OSX clients, note that the permissions the server
grants and the permissions OSX *thinks* it has don't tend to stay in sync very
well. The best thing I've found to deal with this so far is to force OSX to
think it has 0777 -- it won't, the real permissions will be controlled by the
samba settings above as they are for all other clients, but at least OSX won't
get in the way.

::

    # ./bin/osx-samba-mount HOSTNAME MOUNTNAME
    ./bin/osx-samba-mount pi-1 pi-1tb
    ./bin/osx-samba-mount pi-1 pi-4tb

To connect on Windows, use File Explorer, right-click "This PC" and "Add a
Network Drive". Then input "\\IP.ADDR\SHARE_NAME". You may need to input the
credentials: "guest:".
